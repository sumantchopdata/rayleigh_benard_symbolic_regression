A data science semester project with Dr Joy Monteiro to explore symbolic regression using data from simulation of Rayleigh_Benard convection using Dedalus and PySR libraries in Python.

First extract the convection simulation's snapshot files from [this link](https://studentsiiserpuneacin-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/chopde_sumant_students_iiserpune_ac_in/EkdGV3gCzRdKld631sSlcNAB0XIVQJFPMJbnu4E-XtcPpw?e=iTK7sS) in the same directory and then run the various RB_model files. The folder has various snapshots corresponding to different Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers chosen before running each simulation.

e.g. The directory _snapshots_1e9_0.2_ has the snapshots of the simulation which ran using _Rayleigh=1e9_ and _Prandtl=0.2_.
